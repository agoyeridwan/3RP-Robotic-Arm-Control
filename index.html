      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The 3RP configuration refers to the presence of three revolute joints
        and one prismatic joint in an articulated robotic arm. The three
        revolute joints enable the arm to rotate, while the prismatic joint
        allows for linear motion. This combination of joint types provides
        enhanced maneuverability and dexterity to the robotic arm. End effectors
        are positioned at the extreme end of the robotic arm they are used to
        perform specific functions. The end effectors used in this robotic arm
        is a gripper which grips objects within its reach.

        <p><b>Forward Kinematics</b></p>
        <div>
          Forward Kinematics is a method used in robotics to determine the
          position and orientation of the end-effector based on the known values
          of joint angles in robotic kinematics. It describes the mapping from
          the joint space, helping to understand the overall configuration of
          robotic system.

      <div class="inverse">
        <p><b>Inverse Kinematics</b></p>
        <div>
          This is the opposite concept to forward kinematics. Instead of
          determining the end-effector's position and orientation from joint
          angles, inverse kinematics involves calculating the joint angles
          required to achieve a desired position and orientation of the end
          effector. It is used for planning and controlling movement. It also
          allows the system to determine how the robot's joints should move to
          reach a specific target.

      <p><b>Procedures to use</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supply power to the robotic arm through the plug</li>
        <li>
          Connect to the hotspot with the SSID <b>(Robotic Arm)</b> using the
          password <b>mechatronics</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Access the web application through your web browser by entering the IP
          Adress <b>(192.168.4.1)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on the <a><b>"Go to Controller" </b></a>button in order to
          access the robot controller
        </li>
        <li>
          Decide the operation to be performed i.e either forward kinematics or
          inverse kinematics
        </li>
        <li>
          For forward kinematics, specify the joint angles<b> J1, J2, J3,z</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          The controller then uses the angles specified to calculate the x,y,z
          co-ordinates of the end-efector. This triggers the end effector to
          move to the calculated position
        </li>
        <li>
          Note that the value of z specifies the prismatic motion (i.e
          translational motion)
        </li>
        <li>For inverse Kinematics, specify the <b>x,y,z</b> co-ordinates</li>
        <li>
          The values specified are used to calculate the joint angles of the
          robotic arm
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on move to position in order to move the joints of the robotic
          arm
        </li>
        <li>
          Note: When on the controller page, you can access the manual by
          clicking on the funaab logo
